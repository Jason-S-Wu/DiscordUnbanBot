# Discord Unban Bot

Some people don't use the timeout function on Discord so I made a bot to auto reinvite the banned/kicked person.

# Features

- Custom alias for banned user ie `/unban johnDoe`
- Add roles once the user has been invited back

# Installation:

- Clone the repo
- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Modify the `config-example.json` file and rename it to `config.json`
- Run the bot `npm start`
